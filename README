DESCRIPTION:
============

e2retrieve is a ext2 data recovery tool able to recover data from a partial ext2 filesystem.
Partial meens that you can just have 

e2retrieve recognize 3 types of part:
 - regular file
 - block device such as a disk or a partition
 - and logical volume (handled via only LVM 2.0)



COMPILATION:
============

Look at config.h to adjust some parameters, then just type 'make'.



USAGE:
======




LIMITATIONS:
===========
* e2retrieve has only been tested on x86 architecture and surely don't work on something that
  is not little endian and 32 bits.

* Les structures tronquées ne sont pas analysées finement, donc la demande d'une info
  dans cette structure se soldera par un échec.
  Typiquement superblock et group desc.



HISTORY
=======
e2retrieve has been started as a challenge after the crash of one of the disk part of a
LVM (non-stripped)
Tested on LVM (non-stripped) with 3 disks (13GB, 40GB, 80GB), where the first disk (disk
containing the beginning of the filesystem) crashed (around 10GB over the 120GB original
filesystem). There were possibly around 40GB data remaining. Most of the files weren't very
important : mainly sound and video files :)
After after a short analysis of the ext2 filesystem, the theory seems to say that some data
recovery should be possible...
At the end I was able to recover around 36GB of data but without any directory structures
and file or directory names. This was due to the fact that the directory data were on the
disk that has crashed...
Using the 'file' command and 'id3ren' I was able to determine most the file types and rename
most of my MP3 files...
