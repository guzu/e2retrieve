DESCRIPTION:
============
e2retrieve is a data recovery tool able to recover data (file, directory, link, ...)
from a partial Ext2 (maybe Ext3) filesystem. Partial meens that some piece of the filesystem
can be missing. Each part of the original filesystem must be original raw data from the
Ext2 filesystem. 

e2retrieve recognize 3 types of part:
 - regular file
 - block device such as a disk or a partition
 - and logical volume (handled via LVM 2.0 only)

The process is quite long, because e2retrieve must scan through all the data given to
him to search for caracteristic patterns (superblock, directory data, ...).
e2retrieve recover most of the things it can : files, directory (trees), links, special files
(sockets, block devices, character device, pipes) and inode informations interesting for the
user (dates, owner, group owner).

Many improvments can still be done, but for the moment e2retrieve is doing his job quite well.



INSTALLATION:
=============
Look at config.h to adjust some parameters (most don't need to be modified, but some
related to dates can be), then just type 'make'.



USAGE:
======
See --help for options and EXAMPLE section below...



EXAMPLE:
========
This creates an image (large enough to include 3 superblocks):
 $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/ext2fs.img bs=1M count=40
 $ /sbin/mke2fs -F -b 1024 /tmp/ext2fs.img
 $ su -
 # mkdir /tmp/loop
 # mount /tmp/ext2fs.img /tmp/loop -t ext2 -o loop
 # cp -a /etc /dev /tmp/loop 2> /dev/null
 # umount /tmp/loop

From here you can split (with split or with dd with the 'skip' option) the image file or let
it like that and give some of parts to e2retrieve. e2retrieve assume that the parts in arguments
are "sorted". e2retrieve can't/don't deal well with parts that are consecutives (i.e. given two
parts A and B, last byte of A is just followed by the first byte of B in the original raw data).

So:
 $ e2retrieve --dumpto=/tmp/recover /tmp/ext2fs.img
or
 $ e2retrieve --dumpto=/tmp/recover /tmp/ext2fs.part[135]
where ext2fs.part* are pieces of the original ext2fs.img image file.

Directory /tmp/recover will be created by e2retrieve, and will contain recovered data.
In /tmp/recover you will find 3 files usefull for e2retrieve and 2 or more directories, one
'orphans' that contains files that can't be attached to any directory, and one or more no_name*
directories that are root directories e2retrieve as been able to recover.
For example if you got:

 /
 |
 +-B
   |
   C

where /, B and C are directories and that e2retrieve can't find B directories data, you will get
two root directories for / and C directories.

If you do run e2retrieve as superuser, it will be able to do some of its job like recovering and
setting owner and group owner.



LIMITATIONS:
============
* e2retrieve has only been tested on x86 architecture and surely don't work on architectures
  that isn't little endian and 32 bits.

* my english is quite bad so don't blame me, I've done a big effort :)

* from a little experience it looks like for an easy recovery after a crash or forced
  reboot, Ext3 keep some meta fields to zero. So the analyse must be adapted to deal with this
  "problem".

* e2retrieve is trying to guess most of the things alone but sometime a bad guess can lead to
  bad recovery. So, an IHM that would allow the user to help e2retrieve could be a good idea.
  


HISTORY:
========
e2retrieve has been started as a sort of personal challenge after the crash of one disk
disk part of a LVM (non-stripped). The first disk (from 13GB, 40GB and 80GB) crashed.
This disk contained the first 10GB of the filesystem. There were possibly around 40GB or 60GB
remaining data on the other disks (the filesystem wasn't full). 
After after a short analysis of the ext2 filesystem, the theory seems to say that some data
recovery should be possible...
At the end I was able to recover around 36GB of data but without any file or directory names, 
because directory data were on the disk that crashed.
Using the 'file' command and 'id3ren' I was able to determine most the file types and rename
more than half of the MP3 files recovered...



INFOS:
========
e2retrieve is able to linked against uClibc, and a floppy disk with e2retrieve, LVM2.0 lib and
tools, Linux kernel 2.4.19 + device-mapper, uClibc, BusyBox, fdisk and mke2fs is available.
This floppy could be usefull if you want to recover from IDE disks and that you don't have enough
IDE slots to put disks to recover from, disks for recovery and a system to boot from.
You also should be able to mount an NFS export with this floppy, allowing you to save recovered
data onto another machine.
