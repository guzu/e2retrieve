* when directory blocks have been identified, try to determine which blocks can be
  concatenated.

* some blocks are marked in the block bitmap data as used but doesn't seems
  to correspond to something. So they are analysed by the scan_for_directory_block.

* in mark_data_blocks don't forget to collect data blocks of directories
  from which we have the inode but not the first block containing the stub.

* fix: if part is a block device, logi_offset is equal to phys_offset or
  must be adjusted taking into account phys_offset value. 
  fix: the if condition in get_part (block.c)

* make more use of the LOG function :)

* generally, structures are fully loaded, but it can happen that
  only a part of the structure is available. But it might be possible
  reassemble every portion available to recreate the whole structure.
  In the case of the superblock, only few field are interesting for us
  so when we are sure to have all these fields every thing is fine (more
  or less).
