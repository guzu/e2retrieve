* fix: if part is a block device, logi_offset is equal to phys_offset or
  must be adjusted taking into account phys_offset value.

* fix the if condition in get_part (block.c)

* make use of the LOG function :)

* generally, structures are fully loaded, but it can happen that
  only a part of the structure is available. But it might be possible
  reassemble every portion available to recreate the whole structure.
  In the case of the superblock, only few field are interesting for us
  so when we are sure to have all these fields every thing is fine (more
  or less).
